What is TAO
------------------ 

[The ACE ORB (TAO)](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/TAO-overview.html) , which is a standards-based, CORBA middleware
framework that allows clients to invoke operations on distributed
objects without concern for object location, programming language, OS
platform, communication protocols and interconnects, and
hardware. [ACE (ADAPTIVE Communication
Environment)](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/ACE-overview.html)
is an OO framework that implements many core patterns of concurrent
communication software. Since TAO is built on ACE, ACE should be built first. See installation instructions.
